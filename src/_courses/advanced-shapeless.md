## Overview

Essential Shapeless is a course aimed at
experienced Scala developers wanting
to eliminate boilerplate from their codebases.
The course works through
several in depth examples of type class derivation
designed to cover the main theoretical topics required
to understand type class derivation using shapeless.

## Course Overview

In the morning we cover the following aspects of type theory
used by key parts of shapeless machinery:

 - Algebraic data types and type classes
 - Generic representations: `HLists` and `Coproducts`
 - Dependent types
 - Literal types and type tagging
 - Polymorphic functions
 - Type level natural numbers

During the afternoon we put the theory into practice
on a number of worked examples of type class derivation,
drawn from a library of possibilities:

 - Serialization
 - Equality checking
 - `Monoid` and `Semigroup`
 - Validation rules
 - Diffs and patches
 - Random value generation
