## Overview

This course covers a comprehensive set of topics required to create web sites and web services in Play.

Use Play's *Twirl* templating language to populate web pages with dynamic content. Build HTML5 content using your choice of Javascript, Coffeescript, Less, and/or CSS. Integrate client and server with AJAX and JSON. Write functional tests using Fluentlenium.

Write fast, non-blocking asynchronous code using futures and promises. Efficiently process and validate JSON data. Integrate with third party web services using Play’s WS client API. Build your APIs using clean, testable development practices.

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this course you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language. We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](/training/courses/essential-scala) as the perfect complement to this course.

- Confidently write HTML and text page templates using Twirl templates
