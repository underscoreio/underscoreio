For Christmas 2015 I bought myself [Evidence Based Teaching][ebt] and it has blown my mind. For a while I've been dissatisfied with how we teach Scala. While I think we've done a good job with the written material in our books I haven't been so happy with how that's been delivered in our online and on-site courses. In this context Evidence Based Teaching (EBT) has been the perfect book. Here's a quick rundown of what I've learned so far and the changes I intend to make for our courses.

## [Do Shut Up!][do-shut-up]

The number one point is to get out of the way and let the students engage with the material. It's too easy to confuse teaching with lecturing.

## Different Modalities

Coding tasks often get stuck in the weeds "what import is missing here". There are at least three different levels that students need to learn

- the big principles (immutability, composition)
- the specific abstractions (algebraic data types)
- the implementation in Scala (sealed traits, final case classes)

Need to work across a variety of modalities so that each level can be addressed.

## Show, Don't Tell

Use graphics.

## Project Work

Small projects all integration of concepts and levels. We have some bigger case studies but the jump between them and the other work is too large. 

## [Changes][changes]

Based on this there will be a number of changes in our courses.
