Every program needs an error handling strategy.

Most people using Scala are writing mission critical applications, and want robust error handling. In our code reviews we too often see ad-hoc error handling.

Last month on the blog we ran a mini-series on error handling.

Jonathon's post shows two strategies: using the type system to avoid the possibility of errors in the first place, and then using the type system to catch errors that can't be avoided. My post goes deep into handling errors, showing how to systematically build robust error handling code (a teaser: don't use `Try`)

## Pre-release of Advanced Scala with Scalaz 

## Edinburgh Events

## Scala Days SF

[Scala Days SF](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-sanfran-2015) is the next big event in the Scala calendar.
Miles and I will be representing Underscore in San Francisco.
We have organised a few events while we are there:

- a [free one day introduction to Scala](http://underscore.io/events/2015-03-15-creative-scala.html);
- a [one day course on Scalaz](http://underscore.io/events/2015-03-19-essential-scalaz.html) taught in collaboration with Underscore Associate [Adam Rosien](http://rosien.net/); and
- a [free one day workshop on Shapeless](http://underscore.io/events/2015-03-20-shapeless.html).

For the introduction to Scala we are looking for experienced Scala developers to act as teaching assistants, in addition to those with little or no Scala experience who want to learn more.

## Creative Scala


Till next time.

Noel
