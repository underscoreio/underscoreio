## Faster Progress For Your Team

With any new technology your team will pick up idioms, best practices, and tricks as they go.
<strong>Mentoring speeds up this process</strong>, by having experienced developers regularly pair with your team.

Mentoring will help your team address the problems they face using the best of Scala,
including functional programming concepts.

By <strong>pairing with an experienced developer</strong>, your team will also gain insights into the
wide range of libraries and frameworks used in the Scala ecosystem.

As further support, we provide each developer we mentor with access to the complete catalogue of Underscore training material.

## What You Can Expect

Pairing needs to occur frequently to make a lasting difference.
Mentoring is per-pair, pair is for one hour every working day for a month.

- Each day the team pair. One half is an Underscore consultant, the other is one of your team members.
- This is remote, via video and audio Google Hangouts or Screen Hero.
- The session is driven by the needs and questions of your team member.
- The content may involve discussion, coding, exploration, joint problem solving, tooling, and documentation.
- Each week we report back to you relevant findings and suggestions.
