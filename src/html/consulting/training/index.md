## Learn Scala The Right Way

Scala's unique blend of functional and object oriented programming concepts requires a unique teaching style. We are one of the few companies that focuses on showing your developers *how to think* as well as how to write code.

Our [extensive library](/training) of training material covers everything from first steps with Scala to idiomatic library use and advanced functional programming patterns and abstractions. We can mix-and-match material to tailor content to suit your requirements.

Software development is an ever-chaning world. We're constantly updating our ebooks and training exercises to reflect this, and all of our courses come with free lifetime access to relevant training material for all attendees.

## What You Can Expect

1. On-site training for up to 10 developers (larger class sizes negotiable).
2. Free lifetime access to relevant training material for all attendees.
3. Follow-up by email or telephone.

## Training and Mentoring: Perfect Partners

The best way to bed in your new skills is ongoing pair programming with an experienced developer. Why not follow your course with [one-to-one mentoring](../mentoring) for your team?
