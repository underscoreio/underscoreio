## Your Project Roadmap

Adopting Scala runs as a **roadmapping session**. We work together, looking at your goals, to identify where and how Scala can best fit.

As an independent consultancy, we offer **experience across the entire Scala ecosystem**. We help you select the rights parts of Scala and map out adoption for your goals and team.

## What You Can Expect

This service is for CTOs, team leads, and business stakeholders.

It runs in one day, and focuses on:

- The aims of your project.
- The risks, and mitigations.
- High-level user stories and interactions.
- Appropriate Scala solutions.

The deliverable from the roadmapping session is an **Adoption Plan**. This summarizes the major points of the session, together with additional insights, and a roadmap for delivery.
