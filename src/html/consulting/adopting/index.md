## Scala In Just The Right Places

Our *Adopting Scala* service helps you **lay the path to rolling out Scala**.

As an independent consultancy, we offer **experience across the whole Scala ecosystem**. This includes core and functional programming libraries, web frameworks, database access and analysis products, messaging, deployment, and build systems. We'll help you identify the right way to use Scala to fit your goals and team.

## What You Can Expect

This service is for CTOs, team leads, and business stakeholders.

- We meet to understand your needs and concerns.
- Working with you, we outline an architecture and technologies.
- Where necessary, we identify areas requiring proof of concept exploration.
- We present the architecture so it can be challenged to ensure it meets the business needs.
- The resulting architecture is documented.

A full architecture process is iterative but this service is provided as a time-boxed series of activities. The process takes four weeks.
