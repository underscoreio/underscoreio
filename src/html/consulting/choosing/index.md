## A Straight Path To Success

Evaluating new technology is a critical first step in any project. If you are considering adopting Scala, we can provide the benefit of our experience working with other customers who have done the same.

Our *First Steps* service is a **single afternoon spent on-site** with your team. We will discuss the benefits and risks of your forthcoming technology switch, and help bring key stakeholders on board.

## What You Can Expect

1. An afternoon on-site discussing the benefits and best practices of adopting Scala.
2. An hour-long adoption pitch suitable for board members or senior staff.
3. Follow-up by email or telephone.
