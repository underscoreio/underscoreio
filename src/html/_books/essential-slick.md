  overview: |
    We've seen that developers using Slick for the first time often
    need help getting started with the library.

    For example, there are unfamiliar concepts to learn and work with, such as
    _database actions_. This text gives an understanding of how to work with Slick by walking through the common tasks,
    explaining the methods and types you see, and providing exercises.
  prerequisites: |
    To benefit from this material you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language.
    We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](essential-scala.html) as the perfect complement to this course.
  outcomes: |
    - Practical knowledge of working with Slick applications
    - Understanding the core concepts required to work with Slick
    - Knowing how to use Slicks features for selecting and modifying data
    - Modelling schemas in Slick
    - Making use of the Scala type system with Slick
    - Working with lower-level Plain SQL for fine control over queries
