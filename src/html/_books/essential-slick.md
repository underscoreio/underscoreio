## Overview

We've seen that developers using Slick for the first time often
need help getting started with the library.

For example, there are unfamiliar concepts to learn and work with, such as
_database actions_. This book gives an understanding of how to work with Slick by walking through the common tasks,
explaining the methods and types you see, and providing exercises.

## Early Access Book

This book is an Early Access edition, and covers Slick 3.  All chapters are complete, but we may still make corrections.

Formats: PDF, EPUB, and HTML.

Estimated final size: 130 pages.

As a early access customer you will receive a free copy of the final text when it is released, plus free lifetime updates thereafter.

Your purchase also includes a copy of Essential Slick for Slick 2.1 (completed in July 2015).

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this material you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language. We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](../essential-scala) as the perfect complement to this book.

- Practical knowledge of working with Slick applications
- Understanding the core concepts required to work with Slick
