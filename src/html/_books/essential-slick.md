## Praise for Essential Slick

> "I’ve found the book to be highly informative---and, if you’re using Slick, necessary, compared to the other Slick resources out there. Highly recommended."

> "Having worked in Scala almost 2 years, but never used Slick, I recommend this book. It got me up and running quickly."

> "This book is the missing Slick documentation. I like the style and clear content."

[Joe Ottinger](http://enigmastation.com/2015/11/20/essential-slick-review/), and
the recommendation from [Debasish Ghosh](https://twitter.com/debasishg/status/671038191969951745).

## Prerequisites

We've seen that developers using Slick for the first time often
need help getting started with the library.

For example, there are unfamiliar concepts to learn and work with, such as
_database actions_.
This book gives an understanding of how to work with Slick by walking through the common tasks,
explaining the methods and types you see, and providing exercises.

To benefit from this material you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language. We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](../essential-scala) as the perfect complement to this book.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical knowledge of working with Slick applications
- Understanding the core concepts required to work with Slick
- Knowing how to use Slicks features for selecting and modifying data
- Modelling schemas in Slick
- Making use of the Scala type system with Slick
- Working with lower-level Plain SQL for fine control over queries
