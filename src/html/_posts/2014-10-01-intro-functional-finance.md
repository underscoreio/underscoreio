Functional Finance is a new event in London that Underscore are sponsoring.

The combination of functional programming and finance makes a lot of sense.  The industries have the need for the best of concurrency, the expressiveness of DSLs, and the  productivity gains. Functional gives you this.

(By the way, if you'd like to see an example, take a look at our own Lance Walton's [presentation from CodeMesh](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scala-against-culture). He describes how a small team built a trading platform in 6 weeks in Scala.)

Functional Finance is an event for practitioners wanting to get the most out of applying FP to their business. It's about sharing what's interesting and what we're finding useful.

The first event is at Barclays, Canary Wharf and the talks are _Modelling the order book_ and _An introduction to Datastax Enterprise_. You can find more detail in the [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/functional-finance), which is also where you can sign up to hear about future events.
