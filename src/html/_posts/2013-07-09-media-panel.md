If you look around the UK, you'll notice that functional programming has been adopted by quite a few media companies.

To understand why this is, and what the benefits and challenges are, [join us for a panel discussion](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Media/events/127416512/) on this topic:

* Where:  The BBC Academy, White City, London.
* When: 29 July from 4:30pm, followed by networking and drinks until 7pm.
* Cost:  It's a free event, but you must get a ticket: [Join the Functional Media meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Media/events/127416512/) and claim your ticket from [Eventbrite](http://functionalprogramming.eventbrite.com/).

See you there.
