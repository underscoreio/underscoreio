I ran an updated version of our *Essential Essential Scala* workshop (E<sup>2</sup>S) at [Hack the Tower].

E<sup>2</sup>S is a one-day crash course in Scala for programmers of all backgrounds. The content is based on our commercial [Essential Scala] course, which teaches as much about developing a functional programming mindset as it does writing Scala code. The [slides] and [exercises] are open source, and we're happy to run regular free workshops to get new people into the Scala community.

Hack the Tower provided an excellent background and audience for the event. The view from the 27<sup>th</sup> floor of the Heron Tower was simultaneously spectacular and terrifying -- here's a photograph as proof...

The material went down well with the crowd, who had a diverse background of Java, Python, PHP, and other languages. We got through almost everything inside of five hours but skipped some of the last section (on generics) to keep to time. I got some nice feedback at the end, too -- here's an example (thanks Ruth -- cheque's in the post):

Thanks to [Andy Hicks] and [John Stevenson] for hosting me at Hack the Tower. We plan on re-using E<sup>2</sup>S to promote Scala for free at any conferences and meetups we can. [Contact us on Twitter] if you'd like us to come and talk about Scala in your area!
