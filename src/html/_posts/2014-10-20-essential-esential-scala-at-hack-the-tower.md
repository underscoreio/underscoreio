I ran an updated version of our *Essential Essential Scala* workshop (E<sup>2</sup>S) at [Hack the Tower]. Thanks to [Andy Hicks] of the [London Scala User Group] for hooking me up, and to [John Stevenson] and the [Hack the Tower] team for hosting me.

Here's a photo as proof. The view from the 27<sup>th</sup> floor of the Heron Tower was simultaneously amazing and terrifying, as were the turbo lifts (which were on the *outside* of the building):

E<sup>2</sup>S is something Noel put together for a workshop at Devoxx 2013 -- a three hour crash course in Scala for programmers of all backgrounds. Hack the Tower was a little more leisurely -- we took about five hours and skipped some of the last section. The content is based on our commercial [Essential Scala] course, which teaches as much about developing a functional programming mindset as it does writing Scala code.

The material went down well with the crowd, who had a diverse background of Java, Python, PHP, and other languages. I got some nice feedback at the end, too -- here's an example (thanks Ruth -- cheque's in the post):

We plan on re-using E<sup>2</sup>S to promote Scala for free at any conferences and meetups we can. We've even open sourced the [content] and the [exercises] on Github. I'm convinced that I can get it back down to three hours with a little editing and swapping around. [Contact us on Twitter] if you'd like us to come and talk about Scala in your area.
