[Scala Exchange 2014](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1948-scala-exchange-2014) [submissions](https://docs.google.com/a/untyped.com/forms/d/1FfPndvuyR7olRjvgqyn6mWhpnFwqAAYZCyIt-HEr4-4/viewform) are due in only 3 weeks. For the first time, Underscore are offering [assistance to new speakers](http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2014/06/30/underscores-new-speaker-program.html). We've had a great uptake for our programme, and we are closing the programme to new applicants on Friday, 15 August.

What does the programme get you? We'll help you formulate a great talk proposal, provide speaker training, and assist will writing your presentation all for free. And we'll also help cover costs for travel and accommodation.

You only have a week left to apply, so if you're thinking of doing so [sign up now](http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2014/06/30/underscores-new-speaker-program.html).

(If you're thinking of attending Scala Exchange, but not speaking, you still have time to apply for assistance. That part of the programme will close much later.)
