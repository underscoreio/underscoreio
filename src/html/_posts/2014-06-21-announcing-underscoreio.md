We are thrilled to announce the launch of [underscore.io](http://underscore.io), our new web site for Scala training and mentoring. We are launching our new [mentoring programme](http://underscore.io#mentoring) <em>today</em> to provide ongoing support for teams after receiving training, and over the coming months we will be publishing [online versions](http://underscore.io#online) of our most popular face-to-face courses.

### Mentoring

Training is the perfect way to get your team up to speed quickly, but what do you do once the course is over? Our mentoring services are the answer.

Mentoring is the perfect compliment online and face-to-face training. Our experts provide your developers with one-on-one support via face-to-face meetings, online hangouts, support emails, and code reviews. We help point you in the right direction, and you get on with the work at hand knowing you're using the best practices and technology choices for your project.

Once we are integrated with your team, we are in the best position to help manage code quality. We can advise on the best way to architect, develop, and test your code to produce the highest quality product.

### Online Training

While face-to-face training is the best way to provide lots of benefit to your team over a short time, it can be difficult to timetable a course for everyone at once.

Our online courses are a great way of providing the same content in a format that can be consumed gradually over a longer period. Over the Summer we will be launching online versions of our most popular courses in video and book form.
