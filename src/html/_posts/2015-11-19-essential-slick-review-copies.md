# What's new?

When we started writing Essential Slick, Slick 2.1 was out and work was progressing on Slick 2.2.
The 2.2 version turned out to be a large change, and instead Slick 3.0 was born.
It really was a big change, but we've caught up: [Essential Slick] now covers Slick 3 (it's for 3.1 as well as 3.0).

The latest change to the book has been to add a chapter on _action combinators_.
These allow you to combining multiple queries into a single, runnable action,
possibly making choices based in the results of other queries.
This is an important part of Slick, and it deserves a chapter to itself.

For those of you still using Slick 2 (I'm currently working on a project that does),
we bundle the version of the book for Slick 2 with Slick 3, so you're covered.

# Blog Review

We're also trying something new.
If you have a blog, and can write a review, we'll send you a free copy of Essential Slick.
If that appeals, take a look at the details on the [sign up form].
