# What's new?

When we started writing Essential Slick, Slick 2.1 was out and work was progressing on Slick 2.2.
The 2.2 version turned out to be a large change---so large that it became Slick 3.
It really was a big change, but we've caught up: [Essential Slick] now covers Slick 3 (it's for 3.1 as well as 3.0).

The latest addition to the book has been to add a chapter on _action combinators_.
These allow you to combine multiple queries into a single, runnable action,
possibly making choices based in the results of other queries.
This is an important part of Slick, and it deserved a chapter to itself.

But even if you're still using Slick 2 (I've been working on a project that does), Essential Slick can help.
We bundle a version of the book for Slick 2 with the Essential Slick downloads. So you get both.

# Blog Review Copies

We're also trying something new.
If you have a blog, and can write a review, we'll send you a free copy of Essential Slick.

If that appeals, take a look at the details on the [sign up form].
