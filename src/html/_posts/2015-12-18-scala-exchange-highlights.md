Scala Exchange holds a special place in the hiveheart of Underscore. We've been attending since the very beginning in 2011 (before Underscore was formed!) and have more recently taken an active role growing the conference as part of the program committee.

We'd like to highlight some of the talks we most enjoyed from this year's edition of the conference, which was easily the biggest and busiest so far.

We've had many people tell us that [Jessica Kerr's][jessitron] opening keynote was the best talk of the conference. No doubt about it, she rocked. <more here>

[Laura's Blėdaitė][lrb] was a new speaker at Scala Exchange who delivered an [awesome talk on the Count-Min Sketch][count-min]. The Count-Min sketch is not a cartoon villian, but a way of counting the occurrence of specific items without consuming much memory. The secret to this is ... well, go watch the talk! It's a very neat algorithm, and Laura does a great job explaining it and giving examples of its use at Twitter.
