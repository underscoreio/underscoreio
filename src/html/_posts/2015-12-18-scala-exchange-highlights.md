Scala Exchange holds a special place in the hiveheart of Underscore. We've been attending since the very beginning in 2011 (before Underscore was formed!) and have more recently taken an active role growing the conference as part of the program committee.

We'd like to highlight some of the talks we most enjoyed from this year's edition of the conference, which was easily the biggest and busiest so far.

We've had many people tell us that [Jessica Kerr's][jessitron] opening keynote was the best talk of the conference. No doubt about it, she rocked, , speaking about broad and important themes of community and teaching.

She also included some concrete points that gained a lot of attention from later speakers: include imports in all code samples, and avoid using unhelpful words like "simply" and "obviously".

More importantly for us, Jessica's keynote really complimented the themes we were trying to get across in the programme through workshops, lightning talks, and emphasis on beginner-friendly content. Scala has grown up---the community is bigger than ever, and full of newcomers. We need to welcome and support them, and provide a forum to share new ideas and innovations.

[Laura's Blėdaitė][lrb] was a new speaker at Scala Exchange who delivered an [awesome talk on the Count-Min Sketch][count-min]. The Count-Min sketch is not a cartoon villian, but a way of counting the occurrence of specific items without consuming much memory. The secret to this is ... well, go watch the talk! It's a very neat algorithm, and Laura does a great job explaining it and giving examples of its use at Twitter. 

This year lighting talks were included in Scala Exchange. We caught a few of them, and will have to catch up on the rest when [all the recordings are online][videos].

In the [second lightning talk][lt2] session, [Jeff Smith][jeffsmith] built up a system for _Collecting Uncertain Data the Reactive Way_. The problem he's addressing is machine learning in the context of infinite and uncertain data, and how immutable facts (aka. events) are the cornerstone of a scalable system.  And wonderfully entertaining thanks to his examples featuring savanna animals.

Having to follow that, [Bas Geerdink][bas] spoke on _The rise of Scala at ING_. There's plenty of interesting material in those 15 minutes: ING introduce Scala via a classroom setting; why they focus on functional programming rather than Scala specifically; and what the appeal of Scala is to the business.  Good stuff.

Another first-time speaker, Danielle Ashley, gave a talk that many people told me was the best of the conference for them. [She spoke][inappropriate] about the practical problems of trying to keep functionally pure and avoid state. But she did this in the context of projects you wouldn't normally associate with Scala: a MP3 decoder, and a Nintendo emulator. There was laughter, demos, and much applause.
