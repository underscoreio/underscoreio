title: You Can Increase Diversity at Scala eXchange
author: Richard Dallaway
---

We want to improve diversity at Scala conferences, and I suspect you do too. I'll tell you what we're doing, and also list a few simple things you can do to help.

<!-- break -->

Our New Speaker Programme at Scala eXchange is up and running. But we realize it's about more than just new speakers. It's also about improving diversity.  So we're just going to call it the Diversity Programme.  What does that mean? What does it mean for you?

For us diversity just means:

- new voices, sharing their experiences and views; or
- under-represented groups.

We can help anyone falling into those broad categories. The help is via mentoring, speaker training, and money. But more on that in a moment.

## Would you never consider presenting at a conference?

...because you don't feel you fit in, think you have nothing to say, or because it costs too much?  

[motivate, explain, talk about what you want to hear, learning, 15 minute lighting sessions, etc]

Twelve people are already taking part. Join them.

## Or: Are you already attending Scala conferences?

In that case, look around you.  Who do you think should be talking about the kinds of things you want to hear about? If not you, someone you work with?  Perhaps they need encouragement or pointing at this post.  Talk to them, tell them what you like about what they do or how they look at the world.  We can help from there.  But they need to apply.
