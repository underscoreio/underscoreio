# What is Typelevel?

Typelevel is an inclusive and welcoming ecosystem of projects focusing on typeful functional programming in Scala.
The projects include foundation libraries for functional programming concepts, though numeric libraries, to database frameworks.

It's [more than that][scalax], but that alone is a huge amount of useful and interesting free and open source software to get into.

# What are the Summits?

There will be two conferences:

- [Philadelphia, 2nd and 3rd March][philly].
- [Oslo, 4th May][oslo].

These events are not just for project contributors.
One of the goals of Typelevel is to make the projects more widely accessible,
so we want to encourage participation from people who are new to Typelevel.

This is a great opportunity to learn about Typelevel projects, and chat to the people involved.

# Attending

You can [buy tickets now] for the Philadelphia event.

If the ticket price (US$60) and travel costs are too high, consider [applying for support][assistance].

# Sponsoring

Underscore is one of the sponsors supporting Typelevel.
What Typelevel is doing is super important for Scala.

You, or your company, can get involved:

- [buy a supporter ticket][buy tickets now]; or
- [contact Typelevel] for other sponsorship opportunities.

# Talking

If you know someone who should be sharing their experience at the Summit, please encourage them to talk.

Speaker assistance is available to help firm-up a proposal for submission to the programme committee.
And, if accepted, there will be further support and speaker training available.

There's more on this, and how to apply, [in Dave's blog post][assistance] on the Typelevel site.
