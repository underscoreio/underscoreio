We are excited to announce the release of a new
book and training course---[Creative Scala][creative-scala].
This fun new course uses the functional drawing content we've been working on
for the [online version of Essential Scala][essential-scala-online]
to provide an overview of Scala for complete beginners.

The best part? *Creative Scala is 100% free!*

Creative Scala is aimed at developers who have no prior experience in Scala.
It is designed to give you an enjoyable first taste of functional programming.
We assume you have some familiarity with another programming language but
little or no experience with Scala or other functional languages.

The exercises in Creative Scala are based on
a functional graphics library called [Doodle][doodle].
Doodle is primarily designed to make programming fun and creative,
while being based on universal concepts that can be applied
to any business application.

Head over to the [course page][creative-scala] right now and
download your free copy to learn Scala by drawing pictures
like the Sierpinski triangles above.
Alternatively, get in touch via our [contact form][contact-form]
if you would like us to run a free public workshop at a local community event.
