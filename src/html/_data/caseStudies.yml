    You don't just need reliable technology, but a team to support you on the day
    for any eventualities. As Matthew Evans of QMUL describes it:

    "We commissioned Underscore to develop a recruitment dashboard for data entry and reporting during our yearly admissions cycle.
    The software they created was delivered on time, and is easy to use and fast, It gives us accurate intake predictions in real-time, hours ahead of the estimates delivered by UCAS.

    What's more, Underscore's on-site support rescued us at a critical phase during Clearing, when a networking failure rendered our campus single-sign-on service inoperable.
    Their support team quickly responded to the crisis, implementing a standalone login and saving us from a potential crisis.

    We thoroughly recommend Underscore as a software development partner for mission critical application development."

  title: Platform to deploy, manage and measure NFC tags
  description: |
    Identive Group is a global provider of identification-based technologies and services, spanning physical and logical access control, identity management and near field communications.
    Identive's TagTrail product allows customers to deploy, manage and measure NFC tags, with fixed and dynamic content.

    Underscore were commissioned to consult and implement the initial vision of TagTrail.
    Two senior developers were assigned to work with the Identive team in France, Germany, the US, and the Netherlands.
    Work and priorities were reviewed and agreed approximately every 7-10 days, and delivered and deployed to support an iterative MVP approach to product development.

    The team was subsequently retained, and increased in size, for further development of the concept.
