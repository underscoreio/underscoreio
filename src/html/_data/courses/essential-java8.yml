overview: |
  Java 8 brings many new and powerful features to the table, the most significant of which are *lambda expressions* and the new *stream-based collection API*.

  In Core Java 8 we will show you how to master these new functional programming features. Process huge quantities of data with exceptional speed using the new Java 8 streams. Write secure type-safe code with correct use of the new `Optional` type. Use closures in combination with classic functional programming patterns to increase developer productivity and write shorter and more maintainable code.
