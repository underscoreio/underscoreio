overview: |
  This one day course is aimed at Scala developers who want to learn the power of Scala Macros. We learn the basics of the macro API before going in-depth to implement several complete libraries, including: a data validation DSL, boilerplate-free user-driven sorting and filtering, and boilerplate-free type-class-based data serialization.
learningOutcomes: |

  - Use quasiquotes to create and inspect abstract syntax trees
  - Use generic macros to replace boilerplate code for custom data types
  - Implement the type class pattern using generic and implicit macros
