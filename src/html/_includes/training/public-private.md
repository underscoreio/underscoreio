## Public and Private Courses

We routinely run public Essential Scala courses online. They are open to all and can be booked on an individual basis. Get in touch to find out when the next course is scheduled.

We also run private courses for corporate customers. Private courses are booked exclusively for your team, so you have complete control over the syllabus and schedule. Simply let us know your requirements and we will customise our material appropriately.
