## Online and On-Site Courses

We run taught courses in online and on-site formats.

Online courses are run over several sessions using video conferencing software. We run through each component of the course interatively with your team, give them time to the complete coursework, and go through it with them in a code review format. A complete course may be delivered over one or two weeks with as little impact as a couple of hours a day.

Onsite courses are taught intensively at your offices. Our trainers run through the content and coursework interactively with your team, completing everything in one sitting.
