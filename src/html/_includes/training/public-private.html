    <p>
      We run <em>public courses</em> online every few months. Public courses are open to all.

    <p>
      <em>Private courses</em> are run exclusively for your team. You have complete control over the
      syllabus and schedule---let us know your custom requirements on the booking form and we'll customise the
      material appropriately.
