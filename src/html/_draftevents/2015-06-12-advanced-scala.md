### What

In Advanced Scala we will be exploring advanced functional programming techniques,
focusing on the concepts and use of abstractions from abstract algebra.
We will spend the morning of this one day course "building the toolbox",
learning about core abstractions of monoids, monads, and applicative functors.
In the afternoon we will undertake a case study
applying our new knowledge to a practical example.

The course materials include the book Advanced Scala with Scalaz,
along with supplementary material related to free monads.
You will receive free updates to Advanced Scala with Scalaz for its lifetime.
