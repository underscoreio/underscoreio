### What

Essential Scala is our introductory course on Scala.
Our goal is to teach you to write simple, maintainable, and idiomatic Scala code.
To this end, Essential Scala focuses on core patterns of algebraic data types,
structural recursion, sequencing computation, and type classes.
For more information please see [the course listing](/training/courses/essential-scala).

Essential Scala is perfect for experienced programmers in other languages.
No prior experience with Scala or functional programming is required.
