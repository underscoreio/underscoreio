<!-- break -->

Are you an experienced Scala Developer or a Software Engineer professionally experienced with huge data volumes, passionate to learn Scala programming? Would you like to become part of a collaborative, data analytics start-up engaged with some of the largest and most interesting datasets in the world?

### Who are Teralytics?


Teralytics is a fast-growing technology start-up with great ambitions in supporting the emerging big data economy. Our products transform the way industries, governments and our society works, utilising real-time data from over 350 million people across multiple countries.

We offer our employees unique learning opportunities and the chance to work with technologies such as Scala, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Tableau and node.js. Teralytics is funded by international venture capital firms who previously invested in companies such as Facebook, Spotify, Skype and AirBnB.

### Your role

We at Teralytics Zürich are currently searching for a number of Scala developers across 4 of our teams to help with the rapid growth of our company; we are excited to discuss which would be the most beneficial team for you.

Depending on your preferences you will be involved in taking the unstructured, uncleansed data we obtain from our global partners and providing the base platform for our data science teams, or you will be directly involved in the analytics and insights we derive from our data.

Your responsibilities will include:

  - Driving the software architecture and design of a data analytics platform currently processing more than 100 billion events every day
  - Working closely together with talented developers, engineers and scientists to create scalable enterprise-grade solutions
  - Opportunity to lead small projects within the team
  - Communicate regularly with a multi-disciplinary team of Software Engineers and Data Scientists on status, risks and developments

### Your profile

You are a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in data analytics and its capabilities. You will bring expertise in functional software development, ideally Scala, or professional experience with massive data volume processing using JVM-based languages. You possess strong software development skills such as version control, code review, testing, release, monitoring, debugging and experience with Linux systems and basic DevOps tasks. You have prior experience with large datasets.

Any previous background in machine learning, distributed systems or data describing human behaviour (e.g. location data, web log data, retail data, etc.) is highly beneficial. If you have a background with large scale data processing platforms like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark that is also favourable.

You have good English communication skills.

### Your new team


We are a diverse team of data scientists, software engineers and business people from over 20 different countries with offices in Zürich, Singapore and New York. We are smart, hungry and fast moving; operating in small teams, with freedom for independent work and fast decision making.

Our development work is planned out in two week sprints to ensure incremental progress towards larger projects.

Teralytics is an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
