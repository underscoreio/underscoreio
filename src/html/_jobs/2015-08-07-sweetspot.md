We're SweetSpot, founded and located in downtown Portland. We're a small and well-funded healthcare technology company focused on developing software to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. The team is smart, driven, and growing -- we need great engineers to help us deliver on some fantastic opportunities. As a member of our team you'll make a real difference in the lives of people with diabetes.

As a Software Engineer working on our Back-End development team you'll help us develop modern web-based applications to help patients and healthcare professionals manage diabetes.  You'll develop services, exposed through clean & thoughtful APIs, that will store and process secure health data, generate analytics, and more.  We develop most of our services today in Scala, but our micro-service architecture is language-agnostic and we're open to new tools and ideas.

**You'll be great in the position if:**

* Your passion is building back-end services that are reliable, performant and scalable.
* You could have an hour-long discussion about functional vs. object-oriented programming techniques.
* You're not satisfied with code until it's clean and understandable to others.
* You believe that good automated testing is critical to create good software.
* You prefer working in a collaborative, team environment and have the strong communication skills necessary for effective teamwork.
* You are a fast learner and love to grow your skills.

**Experience that would give you an edge:**

* Experience with Scala, Java, or the JVM
* Experience with Akka, or other actor-based system
* Familiarity with Ruby on Rails
* Knowledge of Docker, Micro-Service architecture, and/or AWS
* Experience creating medical products or working in a regulated industry

**Qualifications:**

* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Engineering from four-year college or university or equivalent work experience
* At least 5 years software development experience

**Additional Information:**

* SweetSpot is a wholly owned subsidiary of a larger and publicly traded company.
* We maintain the advantages of being small and nimble while gaining the advantages of stability.
* We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful stock bonuses, health benefits, and a great work environment.
* We encourage you to submit things you've built, samples of code, commits to open source projects and cover letters along with your resume.
