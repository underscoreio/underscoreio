Are you a master of your coding craft? Trading is the nerve centre of William Hill and we’re looking for innovative software engineers to help us break new ground. Our dedicated Trading Dev cells creates tech which touches every part of our Global business, changing the way our colleagues work and transforming the way our customers bet – whatever their sport and whatever the odds.

We’ve experimented with several languages and tried out loads of code, but are now using Scala with Akka to build our Global Trading Platform, and are proud to say that we were amongst the first people in William Hill to put a Scala system into production. Scala is a critical part of our future roadmaps and is here to stay. If you currently work in the Scala space or are taking time outside work to develop your skills, we could give you the training and development to help you become an expert.
We’re predominantly a Java house, and the majority of our coding is done in Java so we are looking for people who have a wealth of experience in this language. But there is more to us than this and we’d like you to join us on our journey.

### Essential skills / behaviours

This is a role for the Polyglots out there! We’re looking for folks who genuinely live and breathe code, and are proactively moving away from Java to more functional languages. We’ll help you to build up your skills, but you need to prove that you’re already putting in the foundations yourself, driving your development via continuous learning.

### How do you stack up?

The essentials:

  - Java
  - TDD
  - Agile
  - Spring

What else do we like?

Scala, Akka, Kafka, NoSQL, eg. Cassandra or RIAK, HTML5, Angular, node.js, Puppet, Docker.
