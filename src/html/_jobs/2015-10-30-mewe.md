We are an exciting, growing, international company that is looking to expand our professional, dedicated and friendly team. We're building the coolest private social platform ever - [mewe.com](https://mewe.com/) - that's why we're looking for a skilled Senior Scala developer, ready to build a backend that can scale to the size of the Internet.

You need to have some experience with developing complex applications. You will work with a small distributed Agile team to create a backend and REST API for our desktop and mobile applications. Experience with Akka, Lift and/or MongoDB is an advantage but as long as you have strong Scala background and experience with other databases, it's not a requirement.
