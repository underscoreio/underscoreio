Futureheads are recruiting for a Scala Developer for a global software development house, based in Central London, initially for 3 months at £450--550 a day.

The software dev house have had heavy investment over the last two years and are going through a digital transformation. Whilst developing previous applications and systems, they are also investing in future projects around building a partner API and developing gamification aspect of their consumer apps. With significant changes to their consumer application, the business are looking for a Scala Developer to support a small but highly skilled team of developers and engineers implementing Back End services.

They have significant deadline over the next 6 months, which they need to achieve to deliver great service in their busiest months (summer). The team are currently using technologies such as Scala, Akka, Play, AWS, CI, Docker, Ruby, and Kubernetes and commercial experience with Scala is essential. You would be joining a passionate, slightly unstructured and at times opinionated team so the ideal candidate will thrive in this type of environment.

To be considered for the position:

- Proven experience using Scala in a commercial environment to implement Back End services.

- Strong background with JVM

- Experience with Akka and Play!

- Good knowledge of AWS & cloud technologies (beneficial if you have had exposure to Docker & Kubernetes)

- Enjoy working in an Agile/Scrum environment

- Passionate about using the right technologies for the right reasons

This position is moving relatively fast so if you believe you are a good fit, want to be part of an exciting team and have used Scala - get in touch with Zoe.
