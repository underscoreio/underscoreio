The Discussion team is looking for excellent and passionate server-side engineers to join us and work on a whole host of services we are building to support commenting, user preferences, content recommendation and other personalisation services.	"The Discussion team is looking for excellent and passionate server-side engineers to join us and work on a whole host of services we are building to support commenting, user preferences, content recommendation and other personalisation services.

We're a small team, we make decisions collectively and we are keen on building robust, scalable APIs to enable new features for our clients (the Guardian website, Guardian mobile apps and so on). We also want to share and promote best-practice here across the department, and build tools and libraries to help with this. Our [ELK-stack](https://github.com/guardian/elk-stack/) is just one example of this.

â€˜We are working on a wide range of products. Currently we are creating a new Avatar service and are about to start building various APIs for personalisation, including user history, user preferences and content recommendations.

Things we care about:
* Informed decision-making
* Understanding our user's needs
* High Availability
* Scalable Design
* Quality Code

So if you're interested in building the next generation of APIs at the Guardian  get in touch.

The boring but still useful bits
---------------------------------------

Our existing applications are written in Scala, Python or Javascript and are built on top of Amazon Web Services. All of our new services are built using Scala and AWS so these skills are particularly useful.

You should be an excellent server-side developer with an interest in:
* Scala - Play and Scalatra
* AWS  - EC2, SQS, SNS, S3
* Python - Django, Flask
* JavaScript - Angular
* Postgres and DynamoDB
* building scalable, reliable services and related tooling

Above all we value problem-solving skills.

You will be part of a small, highly-autonomous team. Decisions are nearly always made collectively and you'll be expected to contribute technical knowledge, ideas about how to work and be more productive as a team and also take part in figuring out what we should be doing next.

We practice continuous delivery and although the team will support you, you will be responsible for making sure your code works and deploying it to production.

Please mention your interest in joining the Discussion team and let us know where you heard about this position in your covering letter. We will try to place you in the team in which you have expressed an interest, however we have many positions to fill and we cannot guarantee you will be assigned to the team you asked for.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

If any of this interests you then please apply for this position now.
