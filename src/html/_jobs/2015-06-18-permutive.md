# About Permutive

We're a London-based startup focused on understanding and recommending content at scale. We use machine learning and natural language processing to algorithmically understand the meaning behind content and make sense of people's wide and nuanced interests based on their behavior.

Advertising supports the free web, but much of it is terrible. The most prevalent form of digital advertising is the display ad, a bolt-on that damages the user's experience and is typically irrelevant to their context. We believe engaging content is the future of online monetization, and so we're building the intelligent infrastructure for deploying revenue-generating content.

We're backed by some of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley, including Y Combinator.

# What is the job?

You'll be identifying, building and owning new and existing parts of our product. This can be anything from developing our data collection, processing, and machine learning infrastructure, all the way through to designing how we present analytics on our front-end product.

At least some of the following should excite you(!):

* Working extensively in functional languages (we mostly use Scala, with Akka, Spray, Scalaz; some Haskell)
* Building large-scale distributed systems (we run a microservices architecture on AWS, making heavy use of SQS, EC2, DynamoDB, and Postgres)
* Designing and/or implementing proprietary machine learning models and real-time personalized recommendation systems
* Building streaming data pipelines to process millions of daily events
* Rapidly designing and building front-end products (HTML/CSS, React, etc.)

# What do we offer?

We have a ton of interesting technical problems to solve. We're constantly ingesting vast numbers of documents to learn from, tracking millions of interactions with content, computing the interests of millions of users, and making personalized real-time recommendations. This scale impacts every engineering decision we make, and we're looking to build a company with super-smart people excited by the challenges it poses.

As one of our first engineers you'll play a central role in defining our tech culture and direction. There's a huge opportunity to effect change at scale through real responsibility and ownership of product. And because at this early stage there's so much to do, there's so much to learn and room to grow.

We're based just off Brick Lane (nearest Tube stations are Aldgate East, Aldgate, and Whitechapel). We have our own private office and you'll get a shiny new laptop of your choice, monitor(s), and your own desk.
