The Guardian's Content API team is looking for excellent and passionate server-side engineers to join us and work on our [Open Platform](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/) which makes our content available not just to the Guardian websites and mobile applications but also to our many external partners and developers.

We’re a small team, we make decisions collectively and we focus on building robust, scalable APIs to enable new features for our clients (the Guardian website, Guardian Apps and many other external clients). We also want to share and promote best-practice within the Digital Development department and build tools and libraries to help with this.

Our main focus is the [Open Platform](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/), a public service for accessing all the content the Guardian creates. It is the point of scaling between the few people that create content for the Guardian and the many people that consume that content, be it on desktops, tablets or mobile devices. We are also building a number of other services to support different types of content such as quizzes, crosswords and polls.

Things we care about:

- Informed decision-making
- High Availability
- Scalable Design
- Quality Code
- Above all we value problem-solving skills

So if you’re interested in building the next generation of APIs at the Guardian get in touch!

The boring but still useful bits
---------------------------------------

The majority of our code is written in Scala and built on AWS and Elasticsearch, We also have some JavaScript applications and one Clojure application.

You will have strong server-side skills. You should also have an interest in:

- Scala -- Play and Spray
- Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana
- AWS (EC2, SQS, SNS, S3, Kinesis)
- building scalable, reliable services and related tooling

The team is small, and highly-autonomous. Decisions are nearly always made collectively. You will be expected to contribute technical knowledge, ideas about how to work and be more productive as a team and also take part in figuring out what we should be doing next.

We practice continuous delivery to production and although the team will support you, you will be responsible for making sure your code works and deploying it.

Please mention your interest in joining the Content API team and let us know where you heard about this position in your covering letter. We will try to place you in the team in which you have expressed an interest, however we have many positions to fill and we cannot guarantee you will be placed in the team you asked for.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

If any of this interests you then please apply for this position.
