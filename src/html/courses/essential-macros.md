# Essential Scala Macros

## Overview

**Level:** Intermediate<br>
**Length:** 1 day

This one day course is aimed at Scala developers who want to learn the power of Scala Macros. We learn the basics of the macro API before going in-depth to implement several complete libraries, including: a data validation DSL, boilerplate-free user-driven sorting and filtering, and boilerplate-free type-class-based data serialization.
