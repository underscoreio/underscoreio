    <p>Distributed systems introduce new challenges in building reliable, scalable software. This course teaches the core theoretical principles for constructing distributed systems and invites particpants to build their own systems using Scala or Java and a set of elemental tools. We will cover three approaches -- message queues, distributed caches, and eventual consistency -- and learn the benefits and drawbacks of each. Finally, in a review session, we will bring together all of the principles covered so far to build a non-trivial distributed system in its entirety.</p>
