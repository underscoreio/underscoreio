## Overview

This course covers a comprehensive set of topics required to create web sites and web services in Play.

Use Play's *Twirl* templating language to populate web pages with dynamic content. Build HTML5 content using your choice of Javascript, Coffeescript, Less, and/or CSS. Integrate client and server with AJAX and JSON. Write functional tests using Fluentlenium.

Write fast, non-blocking asynchronous code using futures and promises. Efficiently process and validate JSON data. Integrate with third party web services using Playâ€™s WS client API. Build your APIs using clean, testable development practices.

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this course you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language. We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](essential-scala.html) as the perfect complement to this course.
