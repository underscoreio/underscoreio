## Overview

Essential Scala is a two day course aimed at experienced developers who are encountering Scala for the first time. Put your existing skills to use mastering Scala's combination of object-oriented and functional programming.

The course teaches you Scala from the basics of its syntax to advanced problem solving techniques. We place a heavy focus on developing the functional programming mindset you need to get the most out of the language. Each section has a practical focus, mixing presentation with in-depth hands-on labs and exercises.

If you are an experienced developer taking your first steps in Scala and want to get up to speed quickly then this is the course for you.

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this course you should have one to two years' experience with an object-oriented (e.g. Java, C#) or functional (e.g. Haskell, Lisp) programming language and a good general understanding of object-oriented or functional programming language concepts.

## Learning Outcomes

Take away a working knowledge of object-oriented and functional programming in Scala. Learn the common patterns needed to get the most out of Scala's extensive collections framework.

Gain a comprehensive understanding of Scala's sophisticated pattern matching facilities and the programming styles they support.

Learn how Scala's flexible syntax, by-name arguments and implicit conversions and arguments support the creation of fluent interfaces and sophisticated internal domain specific languages.
