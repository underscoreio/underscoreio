## Overview

Creative Scala is aimed at developers who have no prior experience in Scala. It is designed to give you a vital first taste of functional programming. We assume you have some familiarity with another programming language but little or no experience with Scala or other functional languages.

Our goal is to demonstrate the building blocks that Scala developers use to create programs in a clear, succinct, declarative manner. Working through the exercises in the book should take two to three hours, after which we hope you will have a feel of what Scala can do for your applications.

The exercises in Creative Scala are based on a functional graphics library called Doodle. Although Doodle is primarily designed to make programming fun and creative, it is based on universal concepts that can be transferrable to business applications.

## Prerequisites

One to two years' experience with a programming language.
No prior experience with Scala or functional programming is required.

## Learning Outcomes

In just a few hours, this course give you the basic mental model
required to become competent with Scala,
However, by the time you finish you won't finish knowing
*everything* you need to be self-sufficient.
We recommend purchasing a copy of [Essential Scala][essential-scala]
for further advancement.
