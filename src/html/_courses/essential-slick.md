## Overview

Essential Slick is a guide to building a database application using the Slick library. It is aimed at Scala developers who need to become productive with Slick quickly.

We've seen that developers using Slick for the first time often need help getting started with the library.
For example, there are unfamiliar concepts to learn and work with, such as _database actions_.
This text gives an understanding of how to work with Slick by walking through the common tasks, explaining the methods and types you see, and providing exercises.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical knowledge of working with Slick applications
- Understanding the core concepts required to work with Slick
- Knowing how to use Slicks features for selecting and modifying data
- Modelling schemas in Slick
- Making use of the Scala type system with Slick
- Working with lower-level Plain SQL for fine control over queries

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this material you will need to know the fundamentals of the Scala language. We recommend [Underscore's Essential Scala](../essential-scala) as the perfect complement to this course.
