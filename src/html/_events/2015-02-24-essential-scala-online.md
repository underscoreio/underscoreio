### What

Essential Scala is our introductory course on Scala. Essential Scala focuses on the core patterns of idiomatic Scala: algebraic data types, structural recursion, sequencing computation, and type classes. Our goal is to teach you how to write simple, maintainable code in an idiomatic functional style. For more information please see [the course listing](/training/courses/essential-scala).

### How

The online version of Essential Scala is run in a studio style. A central part of studio style learning is to critically reflect on code. This means we work on a sizable project for the majority of the course. Each week you are expected to have completed a stage of the project, and be able to discus your code as well as the code of another student when we meet online. Please read [our blog post](/blog/rethinking-online-training) for more information on studio style learning.

The online version of Essential Scala consists of five sessions run over four weeks. Each session lasts one to two hours. You should attend all online sessions. For support between sessions we also have a [Gitter channel]().

The book version of Essential Scala is included in the course, along with supplementary material related to the project. You will receive free updates to Essential Scala for its lifetime, and ongoing access to the Gitter channel.

### How Much

The standard cost for Essential Scala is $1499 / £999. For [diversity candidates]() we offer training at the reduced rate of $749 / £499. For this, the very first time we have run Essential Scala online in a studio style, we are expecting so speed bumps are so are offering all places at the reduced diversity rate.
