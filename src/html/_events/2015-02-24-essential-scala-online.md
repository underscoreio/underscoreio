### What

Essential Scala is our introductory course on Scala.
Our goal is to teach you to write simple, maintainable, and idiomatic Scala code.
To this end, Essential Scala focuses on core patterns of algebraic data types,
structural recursion, sequencing computation, and type classes.
For more information please see [the course listing](/training/courses/essential-scala).

### How

The online version of Essential Scala is run in a studio style.
A central part of studio style learning is to critically reflect on code.
This means we work on a sizable project for the majority of the course.
Each week you are expected to have completed a stage of the project,
and be able to discus your code as well as the code of another student when we meet online.
Please read [our blog post]({% post_url 2015-01-29-rethinking-online-training %}) for more information on studio style learning.

The online version of Essential Scala consists of five sessions run over four weeks.
We will meet online on Google Hangouts.
Each session will last about two hours.
For support between sessions we also have
a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/underscoreio/scala).
We expect work outside of meeting to take approximately 4 hours per week.

The course materials include the book Essential Scala,
along with supplementary material related to the project.
You will receive free updates to Essential Scala for its lifetime,
and ongoing access to the Gitter channel.
