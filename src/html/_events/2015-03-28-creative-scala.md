### What

Creative Scala is a free and fun introduction to Scala.
It teaches the basic principles of Scala and functional programming
through an exploration of computer graphics.

You should attend if you have little or no Scala experience,
but some experience with another language,
and want to learn the basics of Scala and functional programming.

We are currently working on the course material,
and it will be released under a Creative Commons licence before the event.
We will be using the [Doodle](https://github.com/underscoreio/doodle) library
as the starting point for our exploration.

#### Course Overview

We will learn about composition and combinator libraries,
two of the big ideas in functional programming.
We will also learn the basic evaluation model for Scala,
and how to use a good chunk of Scala's features.

With this course we're aiming for fun,
so we're going to have lots of time for exploration.
We will have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity,
and you can work your way through the projects at your own pace
-- or explore your own interests.
