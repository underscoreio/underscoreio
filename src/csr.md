At Underscore we are committed to being a responsible business, both in how we work with our clients but also in terms of how we contribute to the wider community and the world around us. It is important to our employees to work for a socially responsible organisation and our approach therefore reflects our people. We recognise that our activities as a firm have an impact on our communities. We are committed to not only managing that impact but also using the resources we have in making a real and sustainable difference.

Specifically this means:

- Conducting business with honesty and integrity
- Treating each other fairly
- Encouraging diversity within our company and our community
- Avoiding conflicts of interest
- Ensuring environmental responsibility in our global and local operations
- Complying with privacy and data security obligations
- Following the letter and spirit of the law
- Ensuring our supply chains are free from forced labor practices
