## Overview

The goal of Creative Scala is to demonstrate the building blocks that Scala developers use to create programs in a clear, succinct, and declarative manner. Working through the exercises in the book should take a few hours, after which you will know the basics of programming in Scala and have a feel of how the functional programming mindset works.

The exercises in Creative Scala are based on a functional graphics library called [Doodle][doodle]. Although Doodle is primarily designed to make programming fun and creative, it is based on universal concepts that apply to all well-designed software written in a functional style.

## Prerequisites

One to two years' experience with a programming language.
No prior experience with Scala or functional programming is required.

## Learning Outcomes

In just a few hours, this book gives you the basic mental model
required to become competent with Scala,
However, by the time you finish you won't finish knowing
*everything* you need to be self-sufficient.
We recommend [Essential Scala][essential-scala]
to continue your journey learning Scala.
