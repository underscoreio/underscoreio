## Overview

The Type Astronaut's Guide
is aimed at experienced Scala hitch hikers
with an interest in generic programming
and boilerplate elimination.
The book walks you through
one of the main use cases for shapeless -- automatic,
boilerplate-free derivation of type class instances.

The book is divided into two parts.
Part I introduces the general mechanisms
for type class derivation in shapeless.
It introduces generic encodings of
product and coproduct types (case classes and sealed traits),
and shows how to implement type classes
by solving problems at the generic level.

In Part II we open the shapeless toolbox
and show how to apply the solutions from Part I
to a wider range of situations.
We introduce polymorphic functions
that let us map and flatMap over generic representations,
and show how we can count at the type level.

Each chapter of the book is illustrated
with worked examples that are
also available [on Github][shapeless-guide-code].
