title: Diversity in Training
author: Noel Welsh

It's no secret that the computing industry in general, and the Scala community in particular, has an issue with diversity.

Last year we took a small step to improve the situation, with our [diversity programme]({% post_url 2014-06-30-underscores-new-speaker-program %}) for Scala Exchange. This year we want to go further. We are starting by **offering training at half price for diversity candidates**.

<!-- break -->

For most of our training courses will keep back a few places for anyone who:

- is from a group that is underrepresented in the Scala community; or
- would not otherwise be able to access our training.

We intentionally have lax eligibility criteria. We want to accept as many people as possible.

We don't want to turn this into a contest to see who can check their email the most often, so for each course we will have a deadline for submissions and then randomly choose from the applicants. If you aren't selected for a particular date you can be considered for future dates.

Application involves filling out a [simple form](https://docs.google.com/a/underscoreconsulting.com/forms/d/1dyPrqPrhj0MIVsRR3rbxhl2ZrJc3yQ_0XIqJMoGo8iY/viewform). Have a look at our [upcoming events](/events) and see if there is something that meets your interests. If you aren't eligible for the diversity program, please help us spread the word by telling your colleagues who are (a tweet is a great way to get the word out). Subscribing to [our newsleter](/blog/newsletters) is the best way to hear of new events.
