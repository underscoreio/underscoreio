title: "Announcing Scala with Cats"
author: Dave Gurnell
---

Cats, as we all know, are purrveyors of
the finest in [internet culture][link-cheezburger].
With the advent of [Typelevel's Cats][link-cats] they also provide
a solid functional foundation for your Scala codebase.
And, with the (imminent) release of Cats 1.0
comes version 1.0 of our long-awaited and recently-rebranded book,
<em>Scala with Cats</em>. Check out the cover after the break!

This proof just came back from the printers
and I'm pawsitively rolling on the floor with excitement.
After three years in development,
the arrival of a physical book is a hisstoric moment.
I'm not even kitten!

Scala with Cats is about type class based functional programming in Scala.
It introduces a set of core abstractions---monoids, monads, traversals,
and so on---explains them with simple descriptions and examples,
and shows you concisely how to take advantage of them using the Cats library.
And, of course, it features an adorable mascot
illustrated by the supremely talented [Jenny Clements][link-jenny].

The updated version of the book will hit Gumroad later today.
We'll also have a small number of paper copies to give away at [Scala Exchange][link-scalax]
and our upcoming commercial [Cats training course][link-course],
together with exclusive and adorable t-shirts and laptop stickers.
We'll have discounts for both of these events in our next newsletter,
which comes out on Monday. [Subscribe now][link-newsletter] if you want in!
