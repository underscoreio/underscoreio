This week saw our second [Functional Media](/blog/posts/2013/07/09/media-panel.html) event, [Quality Counts](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Media/events/137916712/). We had some great speakers (plus myself) and a lively panel discussion afterwards.

<!-- break -->

 - Malcolm Sparks ([@malcolmsparks](https://twitter.com/malcolmsparks)) of [JUXT](https://juxt.pro/)
   gave a talk on maintaining quality from a Clojure perspective;

 - Underscore's own Richard Dallaway ([@d6y](https://twitter.com/d6y)) spoke about using types
   as constraints to lessen the burden on writing unit tests. Richard's slides are available
   [here](https://speakerdeck.com/d6y/let-the-type-system-do-it-for-you).

 - Underscore's own Dave Gurnell ([@davegurnell](https://twitter.com/davegurnell)) spoke about
   generative/property-based testing with a particular emphasis on
   [ScalaCheck](https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck). Dave's slides are available
   [here](http://files.meetup.com/4442232/ScalaCheckSlides_Web.pdf).

Many thanks to our host and sponsor, [ITV](http://www.itv.com/), for providing a great venue and refreshments for the event.

We had a lot of positive feedback about Functional Media and a plan for a third event is in the works. We want to arrange the talks and discussions that you want to hear, and we are actively looking for recommendations for speakers, so sign up on our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Media/) page to get involved.
