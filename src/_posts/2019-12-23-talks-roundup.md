and gave tons of suggestions and ideas for how to become more ethical in work and life.

> "Be brave, be optimistic, try to change things as best you can. If you can't change things, maybe pivot into something else or get collaborators to try and help you push the van and try and change things with you."

Here at the tenth anniversary, he gives an update on the state-of-the-art in Dotty,
and what we can look forward to in Scala 3.

> "I've also used this process as being a fantastic opportunity to really sit down and take a fresh look at how type class derivation should work in Scala"
