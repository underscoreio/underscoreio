title: Essential Slick Updates
author: Jonathan Ferguson

[Essential Slick] for Slick 2.1 is complete and an Early Access version covering Slick 3 available. The Early Access version currently covers chapters 1, 2 and 6.  We are planning to add  chapters 3 and 4 by the end of September, and Chapter 5 by the end of October.

<!-- break -->

We have updated the text as there have been significant changes to how Slick is used between 2.1 and 3, including  how queries are run, their result type, joins and more.

Interested? Chapters 1 and 2 are available as a [free PDF preview download](/files/essential-slick-3-preview.pdf),


Early Access means it is a work in progress---there will be typos.  Let us know what you make of it via our [Gitter Channel], or [email].
