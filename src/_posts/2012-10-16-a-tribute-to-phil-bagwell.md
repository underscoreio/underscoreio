title: A Tribute to Phil Bagwell

I've just read that [Phil Bagwell has passed away](http://blog.typesafe.com/rip-phil-bagwell). Although I only met Phil Bagwell once he has had a large influence on my life. His [research into data structures](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bagwell:Phil.html) is perhaps what he is best known for, and this work is appreciated daily by Scala, Haskell, Clojure, and other programmers.

I, however, owe Phil a bigger debt as his suggestion led directly to the formation of Underscore. At ScalaDays 2011 I was discussing the trials of constructing a consulting organisation around Scala. He suggested forming a consortium with other consultants, and gave me a few names to contact. The result if of course the organisation you see today. We've met up with Typesafe people numerous times since, and I always hoped Phil would be present at our meetings so I could say thanks. Alas it was not to be, and now of course that opportunity is gone. Phil will be missed by all of us at Underscore.
