Hi,

At the end of last year we ran a Christmas sale to raise money for charity. 
In edition we have the results of that sale, and also the details of three events we're running in the upcoming months, in LA and Seattle.

## Charity Donations!

At the end of last year we said we'd give all profit from book sales till the start of 2017 to charity.
Thanks to your awesome purchasing power we raised about $2700/£2200 through sales of our [ebooks][books] and the [printed version of the Shapeless Guide][shapeless-guide-book] (we don't yet know the exact figure due to processing fees and currency conversion fluctuations.)
We've decided to match funding, so will be donating £2200 each to [Amnesty][amnesty] and [MSF][msf].
Yay!

## Essential Scala and Shapeless in LA

We've holding [two events in LA][la-events] at the end of the month: a three day [Essential Scala][essential-scala] course, and a free evening workshop on Shapeless.
Both events are being hosted by our buddies at [Nordstromrack / Hautelook][haloeng] in their downtown LA office.

Essential Scala is our course for the working Scala developer who wants to learn to use the best parts of Scala to write code that is type safe, modular, and extensible.
The curriculum covers three main patterns:
  - algebraic data types and structural recursion, for straightforward representation and transformation of data respectively;
  - sequencing computations with `map`, `flatMap`, and `fold`; and
  - type classes, for highly modular and extensible interfaces.

The course spends two days covering the foundational patterns, and a full day at the end dedicated to case studies. This is a great opportunity to apply the course material to real problems you're working on, with the input of our expert instructor.

The evening Shapeless workshop will provide a gentle introduction to this powerful library.
The talk is aimed at intermediate Scala developers and is completely free.

Full details, including signup for both events, are [here][la-events].


## ScalaBridge in Seattle

In February we're running at ScalaBridge event in Seattle, hosted by the wonderful people at [Marchex][marchex].
ScalaBridge is building an inclusive Scala community with introductory programming workshops for underrepresented groups in technology.
We've been interested in this sort of outreach since we started [Creative Scala][creative-scala] two years ago, so we're really happy to be involved with ScalaBridge.
Full details are [here][bridgetroll].

## Jobs

Just one new opening on the job board this month: a [junior / intermediate position][job] at Encodex in Nuremberg, Germany.
