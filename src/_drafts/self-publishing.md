## Self-Publishing

Motivation for the post -- answer the questions:

 - Why self-publish Essential Scala and Essential Play?

 - Surely we'd get far more exposure and credibility if we used an existing publisher.

There are three main reasons:

 - Control over the content

    - Underscore isn't about books. We're about making people better at programming.

    - We have a range of products, including books, training courses, team mentoring,
      and so on... the books are at the heart of all of these.

    - Most programming books are popular for a relatively short time-span. People buy
      them, they go out of date... eventually there's enough demand for a second edition,
      but it takes a while.

    - This slow life-cycle of print publishing doesn't make sense for us. Nor does the
      lengthy editing, review, and indexing process imposed by publishers.

    - This is one reason we give continuous free updates -- the books never go too far
      out of date. We believe this is a much better model for our customers.

    - We realise that many people prefer reading content on paper. Fortunately these days
      it's realtively easy to address this through print-on-demand. We've decided to hold
      on this until we see a demand for it (pun intended), but it's definitely a
      possibility for the future.

 - Direct connection to readers

    - "But", you're thinking, "good QA is important. Surely you don't want to sell crap
      to your customers?"

    - Absolutely not! But this is the difference between waterfall software development
      and the agile model. We'd much rather make a mistake or two, have someone spot them,
      and push them an update the very next day.

    - This is another reason we give continuous free updates -- engagement with the
      community (and our customers) is extremely important!

 - Better revenue

    - When self-publishing, we get to keep over 90% of the money. This means more money
      goes back into writing and updating the content, and less goes to the publisher.

    - It may seem like we've put this third to down-play its importance, but that's not
      the case. The money is nice, but it's not the most important thing. Our business
      model is not based purely on book sales.

    - Technical books tend not to make their authors much money. They're too niche.
      Authors do it for the publicity and the improvement to their personal brand.

    - It's true that we have to work harder to market products without publishers working
      for us, but then again we're not just marketing the books. Our consultancy services
      and training courses are all part of the package, and the traditional publishing
      model isn't well set up for these comprehensive packages.
