The festive season is fast approaching and
we're rushing to pack the Underscore sledge
with awesome presents for all the nice Scala developers out there.
In this newsletter we have discounts and previews for Scala Exchange,
discounts for our upcoming Advanced Scala course,
some exciting news about the Advanced Scala book,
and an adventure into the world of audio production.

Are you as intrigued I?
Read on, dear friend, read on...

## Scala Exchange Discounts

'Tis the season for giving,
and what better present is there than the gift of knowledge?

## Scala with Cats Book Launch

And now some big news---Noel and I are happy to announce the release of

We've also commissioned new artwork from our talented friend

If you've already grabbed a copy of the book,
you should have just received an email with an updated download link.

We'll have an exclusive run of physical copies of the book,
together with additional feline promotional merchandise,
at Scala Exchange and the upcoming Advanced Scala course.
(We'll release physical books print-on-demand in 2018.)

## New from the Blog

The <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8784-scala-exchange-2017#program">programme
for Scala Exchange</a> has been announced and
we've written some posts about the talks we're most excited for:

<a href="https://underscore.io/blog/posts/2017/11/15/talks-to-watch-out-for-at-scalax.html">Talks
to Watch Out For at Scala Exchange</a> is the Ronseal of blog posts.
In it I highlight four very different talks that I'm excited about.

I'm particularly excited to hear what Miles has to say!

## New from the... Studio?

We have one final festive surprise for you.
We've been experimenting in the world of podcasting
by recording a short series of interviews with speakers from Scala Exchange.
Our first episode is up: an interview with Ben Parker from ITV
about his talk <em>Almost Type-Safe Error Handling</em>:

- <a href="https://tracking.podiant.co/d/spoke/scalax/episodes/audio/35b040fb8d4be4.mp3">Grab the raw MP3 here</a>

This is an experiment for us so it's a bit rough and ready. Ben's a great guy, though, and it's an entertaining listen. Please let us know what you think!
