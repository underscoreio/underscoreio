## What's On?

[Scala Exchange][scalax] is London's annual Scala conference.
This year, in addition to having three talks in the main programme,
we are sponsoring the conference and helping run satellite events.
Here's a breakdown:

**Miles Sabin---Typelevel Scala Rebooted**

Miles will be talking about the Typelevel Scala compiler
and its role in a number of important bug fixes and improvements to Scala,
including [SIP-23][sip23], [SI-2712][si2712], and [SI-7046][si7046].
The Typelevel and Lightbend compiler teams are working closely
to make sure all improvements are merged back into Lightbend Scala,
so everyone benefits from this work.

**Dave Gurnell---Establishing Orbit with Shapeless**

Dave will be continuing his sequence of introductory shapeless talks
that started earlier in the year at [Scala World][scala-world].
If you're interested in learning shapeless,
be sure to download a copy of
the [Type Astronaut's Guide to Shapeless][shapeless-guide], our new free eBook.

**Noel Welsh---Doodle: Visualisation in Scala**

Noel will be talking about [Doodle][doodle], our functional drawing library,
and its application to visualisation and charting.
Doodle started out as a simple teaching library,
but is growing as Noel adds more abstractions and modelling techniques.

**ScalaxHack**

We're partnering with [Skills Matter][skills-matter],
[Typelevel][typelevel], and the [London Scala User Group][lsug]
to organise the second [Scala Exchange Unconference and Hack Day][scalaxhack],
a free day of talks and hack sessions on the Saturday after Scala Exchange.
Read more and grab a ticket on the [ScalaxHack web site][scalaxhack]!

## Where and When?

Scala Exchange will run on Thursday 8th and Friday 9th December
at the [Business Design Center][bcd] near Angel tube station in London.
ScalaxHack will run on Saturday 10th December at [CodeNode][codenode]
near Moorgate tube station.

This talk will be given by Miles Sabin at [Scala Days Berlin][scala-days-berlin] in Berlin on 17 June 2016.
