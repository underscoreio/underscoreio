# Abstract

Microservices have become one of the main sweet spots for Scala development teams. What frameworks are out there to make delivery teams more productive? How do the stacks, stack up ? And what are the important factors for comparison? 

In this talk Kingsley and Sofia will compare half a dozen of the main microservice frameworks, considering factors from ease of use and supporting documentation to programmer joy. If you're new to microservices or the Scala framework landscape, or just want to see an interesting, fast paced and fun presentation this is for you.
