ScalaBridge is building an inclusive Scala community with introductory programming workshops for underrepresented groups in technology.
We're really proud to be running a ScalaBridge workshop in Seattle.
The Friday night InstallFest, where we get your computer setup and ready to go, is on Friday 17 Feb, followed by a full day workshop on Saturday 18 Feb.
Full details, including sign up, are on the [BridgeTroll site][bridgetroll].

Big thanks to [MarchEx][marchex], who are providing the venue for the event.
