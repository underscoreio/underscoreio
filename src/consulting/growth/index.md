## Growing Your Team

You want to hire great people,
but it's a challenge for all technologies currently,
not just Scala.
For organisations committed to building excellent teams,
we believe the best approach is to **grow Scala expertise internally**.

Our _Team Growth Planning_ service is an opportunity to assess your situation,
your needs, and plans activities to help you grow consistently.

## What you can expect

In this one day meeting, our senior consultants will work with you and your team to:

- understand how you're using Scala;
- how you need to grow in terms of junior and senior levels;
- discuss possible solutions; and
- outline next steps.

The outcome is a plan of activities that could include:

- establishing internal onboarding
- team training
- enhancing your team for a short period

The goal is to **help you become self-sufficient** in bringing on new team members and accelerating their development.
Hiring is as fundamental as sales to a business,
and by being able to grow without having to hire ready-made experience from the market,
you can meet the needs of your business and develop the staff you will want to retain.
