## The challenge

As a result of changes to legislation
arising from the credit crisis,
HSBC needed to offer clients
the ability to clear trades
through a number of clearing houses
in various regions worldwide.

HSBC's Clearing Connectivity Layer and
OTC Cleared Trade Acceptance System
needed to start with London Clearing House,
and be closely followed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the Intercontinental Exchange,
and the Eurex Exchange.

This had to include:

- Connectivity for Trade acceptance to LCH, CME, ICE and Eurex
- Trade affirmation platform and Client reporting portal
- Integration with back-office systems for trade booking
- Margin Calculation Engine

## The approach

The team used agile techniques as
the project is very much like a start-up,
with a lot of uncertainty about
the needs of clients and demands on clearing houses.
We had a suite of automated tests,
continuous integration and automated deployments.
Each app is deployed once a week and
we have had only one production defect
since the project started.

## Scala

Everything is written in Scala.
Web applications were built on Liftweb,
a highly scaleable and secure web framework for Scala,
and Akka, a fault-tolerant actor system.
The application is deployed on Linux.
Fast results Underscore's founding partners
and associates built the entire system from scratch
as this was a new market for HSBC.

We hit an initial deadline
to meet LCH technical tests
within 6 weeks.

The complete system went live in 10 weeks.

In addition to CME and EUREX exchanges,
which went live recently,
a client portal has also been built
to enable HSBC's clients to obtain reports on demand
for trades they've cleared through HSBC.

The team continued to work on the platform
which ran successfully for two years
until it was handed over to an in-house team.
