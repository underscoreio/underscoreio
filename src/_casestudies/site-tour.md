If you want to run an advertising campaign on billboards,
you might well turn to Site Tour to source the sites.
Their technology allows site selection based on a variety of factors,
of which location is just one.

Underscore was first asked to carry out a code review,
as Site Tour was a relatively new adopter of Scala.
This identified several issues with the code base.

When the London office opened,
Underscore also supplemented their internal team
with two senior developers.
This added expertise in the functional
and type-rich style of coding the project had adopted.
In addition to technical contributions,
we helped participated in the formation of working practices
and team culture.
