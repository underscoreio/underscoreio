Large organizations adopting Scala need
to make their teams productive quickly.
And they need to do this repeatedly.

Underscore helped them succeed
with a combination of training and team support.
Our Embedded Team Mentoring service works
by first training the team in the core skills they need.
Then, we spend a few days a week with the team
as they implement a business feature.
We review progress, code commits,
and give break-out sessions on topics that need further exploration.

This is how companies like YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP
can take a team and fast track them
to delivering good quality working code.
