Identive Group is a global provider
of identification-based technologies and services,
spanning physical and logical access control,
identity management and near field communications.
Identive's TagTrail product allows customers to deploy,
manage and measure NFC tags,
with fixed and dynamic content.

Underscore were commissioned to consult
and implement the initial vision of TagTrail.
Two senior developers were assigned
to work with the Identive team in France,
Germany, the US, and the Netherlands.
Work and priorities were reviewed
and agreed approximately every 7-10 days,
and delivered and deployed to support
an iterative MVP approach to product development.

The team was subsequently retained,
and increased in size,
for further development of the concept.
