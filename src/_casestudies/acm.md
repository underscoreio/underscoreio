When you're the leader in the compliance
and regulatory services industry,
you need to keep pushing your product forward.
And in that case, sometimes you need extra hands
to add and improve features.

Underscore was able to supply an expert in the technology in use,
and the individual is able to work remotely as part of the team.
Features are sketched out, delivered, and put into production.

Both Underscore and ACM have plenty of experience with remote work.
The trick is effective communication,
and being a good fit into the team culture.
