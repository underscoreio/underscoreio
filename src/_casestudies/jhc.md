JHC is an technology and consulting expert for financial markets.
As an IBM partner, their core systems run
on IBM iSeries Power systems using DB2.

Underscore's initial involvement was to help assess Scala
as a viable platform for building a new product.
Later, a partner was placed with the core team
to help them import the experience they needed.
In particular, this was focused on a database framework
to be rolled out to teams around the company,
dealing with features specific to DB2.

As Ian Haines, CTO, JHC Systems Limited put it:
Underscore "took a very active part in our project"
and "became a key member of the team."

"We have ended up with some very clever and idiomatic Scala code
which aims to give the developers
a comprehensible view of our application domain
while generating efficient JDBC queries to run over our database."
