You're building a great new team,
but they have limited experience of Scala and the Scala ecosystem.
What do you do?

Underscore helped by training the team
to put everyone on the same page,
and then continued that support
with Q&A, code review, remote pair programming.
This kind of mentoring isn't just about specific technical questions.
It's also about helping individuals approach their work
with a functional Scala mind set,
to make the most of the language and platform.

Scheduling this kind of developer support is not without issues,
but it does pay off when a developer reports that
a session gives "exactly what [they] needed help with".
