## Working here

All our software is built an in iterative, incremental manner, so you’ll be able to see new work go live, sometimes immediately -- to millions of visitors around the globe. XP and Kanban heavily influence our flavour of agile and if something isn’t working, we change it.

We provide teams with an internal CloudFoundry environment, and a continuous delivery toolchain that makes getting a new project to live as easy as a few lines of metadata. We aim to make infrastructure as painless as possible, and ensure our developers are both able and trusted to get software live and to support it.

Our teams are cross-discipline so that our work delivers value to both the business and our customers: business analysts and UX designers work with stakeholders to coordinate research and understand requirements, developers pair with quality analysts to develop the most robust solutions, and our platform and tool engineers work across the organisation to ensure our infrastructure never lets us down.

On top of this we offer a great range of benefits including flexible working with one day a week from home, a competitive salary, pension contributions, 25 days holiday and many more.
