## What do we do?
We create software to onboard (open accounts) for complex corporates at Barclays Bank.
 
## How do we do this?
We work closely with the business to create well tested, well refactored code, that we deliver weekly to production, following mostly Agile/XP practices.
 
## What technologies do we use?
The main technologies involved are Scala/Oracle (backend), and Elm/React/Redux (frontend).
 
## Who are we looking for?
Senior developers who have worked in highly agile teams. Developers who like to pair (even when remote). Preferably with Scala experience.
 
## When do we need someone?
Today! But there will be an agency driven process for background checks etc.
