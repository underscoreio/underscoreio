We (Swarms) are looking for a lead backend (Play/Scala) developer! Our mission is to combine human and machine intelligence on our mobile crowd working platform. We are in our seed phase and just started to scale our first use cases. Our app is already in use around the globe with a focus on India, the US and refugees in middle east and we have paying customers from Europe and more from the US in our pipeline. We’d prefer to have you on-site in Berlin/Bielefeld but are already setup as a remote startup so you could also work up to 80% remote and 20% on-site with the whole team on our ‘hackatrips’. The salary range is $50-80k + 1-3% ESOPS. We are not looking to work with agencies.

If you want to know more about us, shoot me an email to stubbi@swarms.com. More information can also be found at http://www.swarms.com/joinus/. Looking forward to hear from you!
