<!-- break -->

Our client needs our help to implement their leading product with banks and other big clients internationally.

Modern tech stack:

+ Scala (absolutely core requirement)
+ Apache Spark (very very very nice to have)
+ Elastic Search (nice to have)

We are looking for different levels of Scala experience, from 1 year+.

For those with several years of Scala experience, there is good scope to quickly move into a team lead role. For more junior developers you will be working on a clean code base and learning from developers/architects that have built/designed the product.

In all cases, we are looking for people that are *passionate* about Scala and have a good understanding of it through building / extending data processing systems *in production*.

We are focused on UK roles currently, typically London based, but there is potential for travel abroad for those interested (Europe, US, Australasia...).

If interested please apply, and please consider referring others in your network.
