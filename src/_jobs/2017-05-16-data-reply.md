We are looking for a seasoned Big Data developer available to work in London, starting ASAP.

**IMPORTANT** We need someone who is experienced, who can help challenge the approach and contribute new ideas. This is not a 'learn on the job' role!

Requirements:

  1. Significant scala expertise in a Big Data environment (i.e. you have written and maintained *production* pipelines, processing large datasets).
  2. Commitment to test-driven development (TDD), evidenced by using it a lot professionally and being able to explain benefits from practical experience, not book theory.
  3. Good Spark experience (dataframes on 2.0)

Other signals you are the right person:
- Good SQL skills
- Reasonable Python skills
- Unix command line

In this role you will join us as a consultant and be deployed onto a project with our client who is a leading UK brand working with some huge datasets. The pipelines you develop will support industry-leading, cutting-edge use cases.
