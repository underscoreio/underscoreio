We are keenly focused on providing
excellent products and experiences to our users.
As a software engineer at Goodlord
you will work within a cross-functional product team
to build the software that
a majority of agents, tenants, and landlords
will use in our modern tenancy industry.

Much of the technical challenge in our domain
comes from the architectural complexity
of comfortably supporting the myriad features necessary
to satisfy the broad needs of our customers.
To keep things simple we favour functional solutions
and use Scala on the back-end
and functionally-minded tools and patterns on the front-end.

We do have dedicated systems
and front-end engineers at Goodlord,
but most of us work as full-stack engineers
and are capable of delivering
well-designed and well-implemented solutions
wherever appropriate.

We are looking for bright engineers
from varied technical backgrounds
who can demonstrate
strong technical skills and experience
to join our team.

## Responsibilities

- Design and implement features through the full-stack
  using a variety of languages
  (predominantly Scala, TypeScript, and JavaScript)
- Maintain and deploy well-tested software
  in a continuous delivery environment
  (incl. participating in design and code reviews)
- Work within and contribute to
  a cross-functional product team
  and manage individual commitments to a high standard

## Skills and Qualifications

- Minimum
  - BSc/MSc Computer Science
    or related technical field
    (or equivalent experience)
  - 3+ years of commercial experience
    in web application development (both back/front-end)
    and a passion for building great software.
  - High proficiency in written and spoken English

- Preferred
  - Solid grasp of functional programming concepts
  - 2+ years Scala experience
    (ideally from the functional end)
  - Experience working on multi-tenanted
    platforms/architectures
