Backend Engineer
at OVO Energy
Notting Hill Gate, London

OVO is the UK’s leading independent energy technology company and supplier - we serve nearly one million customers with intelligent energy services. 
Today OVO is no longer simply a energy retail business: it is group of innovative, dynamic companies, all striving to harness technological advances with great consumer propositions to create more abundant clean energy for everyone.

Just some of the tools we use to get the job done: 
- Scala 
- Akka HTTP, http4s, Akka Streams, fs2, Monix, Spark
- Cats, Scalaz, Circe, Avro, Slick, doobie, PureConfig,   
- Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB 
- CircleCI, GoCD,  
- AWS, GCP, Terraform, CloudFormation, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes
- InfluxDB, Chronograf, Grafana, Kamon 
- TDD (Scalatest, Specs2, ScalaCheck)  

Why work at OVO? 
We work in highly agile environments with continuous releases; our Engineers are responsible not only for development but we place focus on testing (Unit, integration, UI testing), automating tests and managing infrastructure & environments.
We give our cross-functional team the freedom and trust to find and experiment with the best tools for the job, so that problems aren’t just solved but solved in the most optimal way. 
Our Engineers are building and scaling distributed systems. Our microservice platform is written in Scala andis connected with event streams - we take pride in the quality of the code that we write. 
Our impressive BE community will be there to support you so you can make your ideas heard:
- We have “Backend Communities of Practise” in place. These include groups like a Kafka Community and DevSecurityOperations.  
Open Source Friday, each quarter we spend time working on different OS projects - projects suggested by you. We also run a tech blog.
- Tech Time and Tech Friday’s: ‘lightning’ talks on interesting tech topics. Recent discussions have included ‘Functional Domain Modelling’, ‘A Brief History of LISP’ and ‘Bring your own Effect’ hosted by Chris Birchall. We get together and share things we are proud of or interested in!  
- Across slack channels and via internal meet-ups we promote collaboration, knowledge transferring and if something isn’t working: ‘fail fast’ so that we can share learning from our mistakes across all our teams -  giving us much more time to work on the cool stuff.
- We attend a number of tech conferences then summarise the agenda to discuss new ideas internally and learnt from them. We love to pair program.
