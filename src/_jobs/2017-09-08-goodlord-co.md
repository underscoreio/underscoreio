# DESCRIPTION
We are passionate about providing excellent products and experiences to our users.

As a software engineer at Goodlord you will work within a cross-functional product team to build the software that a majority of agents, tenants, and landlords will use in our modern tenancy industry. To keep things simple we favour functional solutions and use Scala on the back-end and functionally-minded tools and patterns on the front-end.

Perhaps you explore programming ideas in your own side projects, give to the community, or speak at events. Or, whatever it is, we'll be interested in hearing about it. We are looking for bright engineers who can demonstrate strong technical skills to join our team.

# Responsibilities
* Lead the design and implementation of features using Scala, Akka, etc.
* Maintain and deploy well-tested software in a continuous delivery environment (incl. participating in design and code reviews)
* Work within and contribute to our cross-functional product team and manage individual commitments to a high standard

# Skills and experience
* BSc/MSc Computer Science or related technical field (or equivalent experience)
* Deep and demonstrable Scala experience
* Strong functional programming skills and experience would be preferable
* Experience with multiple architectures and languages would come in handy
* Experience writing good, clean and well-tested code at a problem-appropriate abstraction and implementation quality

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
